    "# Target Leakage in Machine Failure Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world machine learning projects, it is common to find features that appear to improve model performance — but only because they include information that would not be available at prediction time. This problem is known as **target leakage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore target leakage using a simulated machine failure dataset. The goal is to predict whether a machine will fail based on available sensor and usage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train a model using **all features**, including those that leak future information\n",
    "- Observe artificially high accuracy caused by leakage\n",
    "- Retrain the model using **only valid features**\n",
    "- Compare the results and discuss why leakage is harmful in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will understand how target leakage can mislead model evaluation and how to build models that generalize better to real-world scenarios."
